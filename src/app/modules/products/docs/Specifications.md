you can also add "paginate=false" to the endpoint to not have pagination

Excellent - that last one looks pretty close to the one Iâ€™m using.

i can see im missing a label for the units in the transformer, but there should also be a "full text label" like "Grams" instead of just "g"

AG [10:25 AM]
Do we have a preference for abbreviation or full label in the drop down?

Nicole Jay [10:25 AM]
i think in the dropdown it could  have both like g (grams)
just in case theres someone who doesn;t know their units

AG [10:25 AM]
OK. That works.
